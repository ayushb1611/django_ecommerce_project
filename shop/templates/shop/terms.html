    <p>Because Amazon.in lists millions of products for sale offered by sellers on the website and hosts many thousands of comments, it is not possible for us to be aware of the contents of each product listed for sale, or each comment or review that is displayed. Accordingly, Amazon.in operates on a "notice and takedown" basis. If you believe that any content on the website is illegal, offensive (including but not limited to material that is sexually explicit content or which promotes racism, bigotry, hatred or physical harm), deceptive, misleading, abusive, indecent, insulting or harassing, blasphemous, defamatory, libelous, obscene, pornographic, paedophilic, invasive of another’s privacy or menacing; ethnically objectionable, disparaging; or in breach of a third party’s confidential, proprietary information or right; or is otherwise injurious to third parties; or relates to or promotes money laundering or gambling; or is harmful to minors in any way; or impersonates another person; or threatens the unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of India or friendly relations with foreign States, or public order, or causes incitement to the commission of any cognisable offence or prevents investigation of any offence or in insulting other nation; or objectionable or otherwise unlawful in any manner whatsoever; or which consists of or contains software viruses or any other computer code, file or program designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer resource; or is patently false and untrue (" Objectionable Content "), please notify us immediately by following our  <a href="#GUID-523AEA8E-920A-4BA4-9EE0-2FCC6C3AB1D8__SECTION_E8DB72AB78B144658B508E816F23127B">Notice and Procedure for Making Claims of Right Infringements</a>.

    <h2> Conditions of Sale (between Sellers and the Customer)</h2>
    <p> 
    <strong>Please read these conditions carefully before placing an order for any products with the Sellers ("We" or "Our" or "Us", wherever applicable) on the Amazon.in (the website). These conditions signify your agreement to be bound by these conditions.</strong>
    </p>
     
    <p>In addition, when you use any current or future Amazon.in service (eg: Wishlist or Marketplace or Amazon MP3 Service), you will also be subject to the terms, guidelines and conditions applicable to that service ("Terms"). If these Conditions of Sale are inconsistent with such Terms, the Terms will control.</p>
     
    <p> 
    <strong>1. Conditions Relating to the Sale of Products to You</strong>
    </p>
     
    <p> This section deals with conditions relating to the sale of products on the website by us to you.</p>
     
    <p> 
    <strong>2. Our Contract</strong> 
    </p>
     
    <p> Your order is an offer to us to buy the product(s) in your order. When you place an order to purchase a product from us, you will receive an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order (the "Order Confirmation E-mail"). The Order Confirmation E-mail is acknowledgement that we have received your order, and does not confirm acceptance of your offer to buy the product(s) ordered. We only accept your offer, and conclude the contract of sale for a product ordered by you, when the product is dispatched to you and an e-mail confirmation is sent to you that the product has been dispatched to you (the "Dispatch Confirmation E-mail"). If your order is dispatched in more than one package, you may receive a separate Dispatch Confirmation E-mail for each package, and each Dispatch Confirmation E-mail and corresponding dispatch will conclude a separate contract of sale between you and us for the product(s) specified in that Dispatch Confirmation E-mail.</p>
     
    <p> Your contract is with us (the Sellers) and you confirm that the product(s) ordered by you are purchased for your internal / personal purpose and not for re-sale or business purpose. You authorize us to declare and provide declaration to any governmental authority on your behalf stating the aforesaid purpose of the products ordered by you on the website.</p>
     
    <p>You can cancel your order for a product at no cost any time before we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail relating to that product.</p>
     
    <p> Please note that we sell products only in quantities which correspond to the typical needs of an average household. This applies both to the number of products ordered within a single order and the placing of several orders for the same product where the individual orders comprise a quantity typical for a normal household.</p>
